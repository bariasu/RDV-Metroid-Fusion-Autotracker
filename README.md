# Autotracker for Randovania Metroid Fusion

This Lua script is made to work with Randovania's Metroid Fusion randomizer and **BizHawk 2.9+** for Windows and Linux

**HOW TO USE:**

[Download RDVFusion_Autotracker_v1.3.zip from the Release Page](https://github.com/bariasu/RDV-Metroid-Fusion-Autotracker/releases/tag/v1.3)

-Extract the .zip, and place the newly created RDVFusion-Autotracker-v1.3 folder somewhere you can find it.

-Then, open BizHawk, and open the game.

-In BizHawk, navigate to Tools > Lua Console

-In the Lua Console, navigate to Script > Open Script

-In the window that pops up, navigate to the RDVFusion-BizHawk-Autotracker-v1.3 folder, and choose to open RDV_Fusion_Item_Tracker.lua

That's all there is to it. The tracker won't appear on the screen until you have control of Samus, after the intial Adam/Computer text cutscene.

**HOW TO CUSTOMIZE:**

In order to customize the tracker, you will need to open the RDV_Fusion_Item_Tracker.lua in a text editor (Notepad++, VS Code, etc.). I left comments in the code, so you may be able to figure it out. There are coordinates you can change to move the tracker icons, but it is a bit tedious, as you currently have to change the coordinates individually. If you want to move it to the right side of the screen, there's also a line that you can edit to move the black border to the other side, which is commented in the code.

If you have any issues, questions, or want to request something, feel free to contact me on Discord, my username is variasu (aka baria). Currently, I plan to add the Level 0 Security Card at some point for whenever Door Lock Rando becomes available, and I may add maximum ammo counts at some point.
